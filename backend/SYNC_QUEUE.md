# Backend sync queue (Path B ← Supabase)

Pending data-behaviour changes made in the **Supabase** backend (`src/data/supabase/`) that
still need to be replicated into the **Node/Express + Prisma** backend (`backend/`) and its
frontend HTTP client (`src/data/api/`).

**Workflow (see CLAUDE.md → "STANDING RULE"):**
- When a data-behaviour change is made, it is applied to Supabase ONLY, and an entry is
  appended here describing exactly what to do in Path B.
- Running `/update-backend` applies these entries to `backend/` + `src/data/api/`, one at a
  time, and **deletes each entry from this file as soon as it is done and verified**.
- Entries are kept SMALL and self-contained so an interrupted `/update-backend` can resume
  from the next unchecked entry without redoing finished work.

## How to write an entry

Each entry is a `## [SYNC-NNN] <short title>` block. Use the next free number (they only ever
go up; deleting done entries does not recycle numbers). Include everything Path B needs so no
re-derivation from the Supabase diff is required:

```
## [SYNC-001] Add `foo` field to Business

- **Area:** BusinessRepository / businesses
- **Supabase change:** <what was done in src/data/supabase/… + any migration>
- **Domain/interface:** <changes already in src/domain/types.ts or src/data/repositories.ts — shared, usually already done>
- **Path B — backend/:** <exact files + logic: prisma model note, service method, router/controller, authz>
- **Path B — src/data/api/:** <exact client method(s) + endpoint path/shape>
- **DB/migration:** <new SQL migration file, if any — shared DB, apply once>
- **Verify:** <what to check: backend typecheck/build, api client tsc>
```
